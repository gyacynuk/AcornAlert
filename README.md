# AcornAlert
This tool automatically checks to see when new grades are posted on Acorn, the University of Toronto's student information service, 
and emails you with updates.

To start using the tool, you first must make an account with mailgun (https://www.mailgun.com/). It is free, and only takes a few seconds.
Once done, add your API key and domain name into the config.json file.

Now you're ready to start using AcornAlert! Simply run the program and it will prompt you for any additional information it needs.
